A simple Python project
=======================

The aims for this project are as follows:

(1) We create a very basic command line utility

(2) It should be structured as a 'package' with an __init__ file

(3) It should have at least one dependency on a non-default Python package.

(4) We want to get as far as creating a .whl file for it, which will automatically install the dependency.
